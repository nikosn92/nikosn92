--Code Explanation --

The JavaScript code defines two variables, num1 and num2, to store the input values, and a variable valExist to track whether both values exist.

The setNumbers function retrieves the values from the HTML input fields and checks if they are both provided. If not, it displays an alert message and sets valExist to false.
The multiplication and division buttons have event listeners that call the setNumbers function and, if valExist is true, perform the corresponding operation and display the result in the "result" div.

--Error Handling--
The code ensures that both input values are provided before performing calculations. If either value is missing, the user will be alerted to fill in both values.
